# Executive summary

We have conducted the research on the PSID dataset which is freely available. The complete dataset contains data collected over 18000 individuals living in 5000 families in USA. Out of that population the selected sample size is 4850 and we have used the entire sample for the research analysis.


We have conducted the research on the PSID dataset with having 2 research questions. First question is “Is education level affect to keep the marriage?” and the next question is “Is working more hours increase the average income?”


Before going to the real questions we have analyzed the available sample and its distribution. During that analysis we have found that the age category of the selected sample is biased towards 20-30 age range with the mean of 38.46and standard deviation of 5.59.


We have developed hypotheses for each of the two research question. For the first question the hypotheses  are “Mean of education level for married and non-separated individuals is not equal to the Mean of education level for separated or divorced individuals” and the null of it is “Mean of education level for married and non-separated individuals is equal to the Mean of education level for separated or divorced individuals” . For the second question the hypotheses are “Mean of average income for individuals working more than 2600 hours is greater than the Mean of average income for individuals working less than 2600 hours” and the null of it is “Mean of average income for individuals working more than 2600 hours is equal to the Mean of average income for individuals working less than 2600 hours”

Based on the results for the first question Mean of education level for separated or divorced individuals is less than the Mean of education level for married and non-separated individuals. Hence inequality of the two mean values holds and because of that we cannot reject our null hypothesis. Therefor the analysis is inconclusive.


Analysis for the second question showed that the Mean of average income for individuals working more than 2600 hours(30955.48) is greater than Mean of average income for individuals working less than 2600 hours(13564.03). And the Confidence Interval is (14244.74,14040.09). Hence we can reject our null hypothesis and accept the alternate hypothesis. This shows that the working more number of hours leads to more income.


### Following is the same summary as bullet points

- PSID dataset is used for the analysis. The sample size is 4850 out of population of 18000.
- Research questions:
	- “Is education level affect to keep the marriage?”
	- “Is working more hours increase the average income?”
- Age category of the selected sample is biased towards 20-30 age range.
- Hypotheses:
	- Mean of education level for married and non-separated individuals is not equal to the Mean of education level for separated or divorced individuals” and the null of it.
	- “Mean of average income for individuals working more than 2600 hours is greater than the Mean of average income for individuals working less than 2600 hours” and the null of it.
- Calculated sample statistics, conducted hypothesis testing and confidence interval calculation.
- Mean of education level for separated or divorced individuals is less than the Mean of education level for married and non-separated individuals.
- Mean of average income for individuals working more than 2600 hours is greater than Mean of average income for individuals working less than 2600 hours. And the Confidence Interval is. Hence we can reject our null hypothesis.
- Getting Marital Status and the Education level is inconclusive.
- Working more number of hours leads to more income.
