# Executive summary

We have conducted the research on the PSID dataset which is freely available. The complete dataset contains data collected over 18000 individuals living in 5000 families in USA. Out of that population the selected sample size is 4850 and we have used the entire sample for the research analysis.


We have conducted the research on the PSID dataset with having 2 research questions. First question is “Is education level affect to keep the marriage?” and the next question is “Is working more hours increase the average income?”


Before going to the real questions we have analyzed the available sample and its distribution. During that analysis we have found that the age category of the selected sample is biased towards 20-30 age range with the mean of 38.46and standard deviation of 5.59.


We have developed hypotheses for each of the two research question. For the first question the hypotheses  are “Mean of education level for married and non-separated individuals is not equal to the Mean of education level for separated or divorced individuals” and the null of it is “Mean of education level for married and non-separated individuals is equal to the Mean of education level for separated or divorced individuals” . For the second question the hypotheses are “Mean of average income for individuals working more than 2600 hours is greater than the Mean of average income for individuals working less than 2600 hours” and the null of it is “Mean of average income for individuals working more than 2600 hours is equal to the Mean of average income for individuals working less than 2600 hours”
