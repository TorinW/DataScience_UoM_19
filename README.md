µs – Mean of separated or divorced individuals
µn- Mean of married and non-separated individuals
H0 => Null Hypothesis        µs= µn
Ha => Alternate Hypothesis   µs ≠ µn
 
 2. "Is working more hours increase the average income?"
 
µh – Mean of average icome for individuals working more than 2600 hours
µl- Mean ofaverage icome for individuals working less than 2600 hours


H0 => Null Hypothesis        µh= µl
Ha => Alternate Hypothesis   µh> µn
