Hypothesis/Question
1. "Is education level affect to keep the marriage?"
- People who have education level higher than level 10 have high probability of ended with divorce/seperated compared to the rest.


µs – Mean of education level for separated or divorced individuals    

µn- Mean of education level for married and non-separated individuals  

H0 => Null Hypothesis        µs= µn  
Ha => Alternate Hypothesis   µs ≠ µn  

 
 2. "Is working more hours increase the average income?"  
 
 µh – Mean of average icome for individuals working more than 2600 hours  
 µl- Mean ofaverage icome for individuals working less than 2600 hours  
 


H0 => Null Hypothesis        µh= µl  
Ha => Alternate Hypothesis   µh> µn
